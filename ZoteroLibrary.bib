	abstract = {The boundary collocation method (BCM) is widely used in the engineering community for the numerical solution of linear boundary value problems. It is commonly stated that the results computed by this method are affected by large rounding errors. This conclusion is based on a simple worst-case analysis using the conventional condition number for linear systems. In this paper we present a refined error analysis for a class of boundary value problems, using the concept of effectively well-conditioned systems. This analysis leads to much smaller a priori bounds for the rounding error in the computed BCM solution. These smaller bounds imply that the numerically computed solution expresses — much more accurately than previously supposed — properties of the ideal BCM solution (computed with infinite precision). Therefore, the intrinsic properties of the BCM can be investigated through numerical computations to a far larger extent than previously supposed, thus allowing for a numerical diagnostic investigation of the BCM. For example, when the BCM is applied to problems with certain geometries, it is observed that the approximation does not converge. Using our new, smaller error bounds, we conclude that the lack of convergence of the BCM solution for these geometries is due to the BCM itself and not to rounding errors.},

	abstract = {on the occasion of his 65th birthday The linear systems arising from MFS calculations share certain numerical effects with other systems involving radial basis functions. These effects concern approximation error and stability, which are closely related, and they can already be studied for simple interpolation problems without PDEs. In MFS calculations, they crucially depend on the position and density of the source points and the collocation points. In turn, the choice of these points must depend on the smoothness and possible singularities of the solution. This contribution provides an adaptive method which chooses good source points automatically. A series of examples shows that the adaptive choice of source points follows the theoretical predictions quite well. 1},

	title = {An influence of the number of reflected modules and the frequency on the efficiency of the muffler with the directed energy},
	abstract = {Up to now, internal partitions make simple elements which provide additional sound wave reflections. As a result, a part of the sound wave turns around toward the source or back and forth inside the muffler. This effect prevents some sound energy transmission past the muffler. The number, shape and configuration of partitions remain a challenging task. In the paper a new two partitions element is proposed and they together are named as the Reflected Module (ReM). The ReM directs the sound energy at exactly determined place of the muffler domain. This assures a better attenuation of the sound. An influence of the number of the fixed shape ReM and the frequency of the sound on the efficiency of the muffler is examined in experimental manner. It has been demonstrated that in some range of the frequency, adding successive ReM, the efficiency is become better and better. Nevertheless, in the future, it is proposed an optimization of some ReM parameters.},
